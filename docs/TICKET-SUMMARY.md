## Phase 1 — Foundation

These must be completed before any other ticket can be built. No component should be started until KNOCH-001 and KNOCH-002 are done. KNOCH-016 (Lenis) must be done before KNOCH-007 (reel).

| ID | Title | Status | Branch | Notes |

## CMS — Content Layer (Sanity)

KNOCH-022 and KNOCH-023 are infrastructure — implement these first. The wiring tickets (024–026) slot in immediately after their dependent section is built. Do not start 024 before 009, or 025 before 007. KNOCH-026 can start now (005 is done).

| [KNOCH-026](tickets/KNOCH-026.md) | Migrate Hero Images to Sanity CDN | `⏸` | — | Deferred — hero is LCP-critical and design-tied; static files are the correct approach |

| [KNOCH-028](tickets/KNOCH-028.md) | Wire Services Page to Sanity | `⬜` | — | After services page is built |
| [KNOCH-029](tickets/KNOCH-029.md) | Blog Listing Page | `⏸` | — | Deferred — blog schema needs redesign (dynamic related posts, YouTube + Instagram content types) |
| [KNOCH-030](tickets/KNOCH-030.md) | Blog Post Detail Page | `⏸` | — | Deferred — blocked by KNOCH-029 redesign |

### 2026-05-05 — KNOCH-007 + KNOCH-022/023/025 DONE — reel + CMS layer complete

**Action:** KNOCH-007 implemented and merged to test; KNOCH-022/023/025 completed in same session
**Tickets affected:** KNOCH-007, KNOCH-022, KNOCH-023, KNOCH-025, KNOCH-026 (deferred)
**Changes:**
- KNOCH-007: ⬜ → ✅ Done. Branch `feature/KNOCH-007-horizontal-reel` merged to test.
  - Horizontal pinned carousel, GSAP ScrollTrigger scrub:0.8, inner parallax via containerAnimation
  - Full cinematic greyscale filter (grayscale(1)) at rest; colour reveals on hover
  - Film-notch L-bracket corners, FRAME label, meta slide-up on hover
  - Mobile: CSS snap scroll replaces GSAP pin at ≤800px
  - Studio files from CMS branch cherry-picked onto this branch and committed
- KNOCH-022: 🔵 → ✅ Done. Sanity Studio running locally and deployed; all schemas live; 5 testimonials, 7 gallery collections, services entered.
- KNOCH-023: 🔵 → ✅ Done. `src/js/sanity.js` hardened with optional chaining, null guards, console logging for debug; `imageUrl()` helper; meta tags in index.html.
- KNOCH-025: ⬜ → ✅ Done (bundled with KNOCH-007). `main.js` fetches `getFeaturedCollections()` → maps to card shape → `initReel()`. Static CARDS fallback uses Sanity CDN URLs directly. `subtitle` field added to `galleryCollection` schema (Studio: fill in "Maryland · 2024" style labels per collection).
- KNOCH-026: ⬜ → ⏸ Deferred. Hero images are LCP-critical and design-tied — static files are correct. Sanity CDN adds latency with no benefit here.
- KNOCH-027: Added to CMS table (was missing). Open — blocked until KNOCH-013.
- Stat counts: In progress 2→0, Done 7→11, Open 19→16, Deferred 2→3

### 2026-05-05 — KNOCH-006 QA PASSED — re-test after fix

**Action:** Re-test by Tester Agent. All 15 ACs pass. PR #10 merged to test.
**Tickets affected:** KNOCH-006
**Reason:** Builder applied fix `fix(interlude): retarget word-splitter from blockquote to inner <p> (KNOCH-006)`. The blocker from the first QA run is resolved — `const para = quote.querySelector('p') ?? quote` now correctly targets the `<p>` inside the blockquote, and all `appendChild`/`querySelectorAll` calls operate on `para`. Word-split produces a non-empty NodeList; GSAP ScrollTrigger animates all words.
**Changes:**
- KNOCH-006: Status changed NEEDS FIXES → QA PASSED
- PR #10: Merged dev → test
- Test report: Result updated to PASSED; Re-test section appended
- Dashboard badge: Needs Fixes → QA Passed (green); PR #10 removed from Open PRs
- Stat counts: Needs fixes 1→0, Done 6→7
**Completed by:** Tester Agent

### 2026-05-05 — KNOCH-006 QA FAILED — NEEDS FIXES

**Action:** QA run by Tester Agent. 1 BLOCKER found. PR #10 blocked.
**Tickets affected:** KNOCH-006
**Reason:** Word-splitter JS targets `<blockquote>` childNodes instead of inner `<p>` childNodes — zero `.word` spans are created, the scroll reveal does not function.
**Changes:**
- KNOCH-006: Status changed IN REVIEW → NEEDS FIXES
- PR #10: Changes requested (comment posted — GitHub API prevented formal review on own PR)
- Dashboard badge: In Review → Needs Fixes
- Stat counts: In review 1→0, Needs fixes 0→1
**Blockers:**
1. **BLOCKER** — `src/js/interlude.js` line 37: `Array.from(quote.childNodes)` iterates the `<blockquote>` (whose only child is `<p>`). The `<p>` hits the `else { cloneNode(true) }` branch and is copied back unchanged. No `.word` spans are produced. Fix: use `quote.querySelector('p') ?? quote` as the split target.
**Non-blocking issues:**
- Redundant `w.style.opacity = '1'` in reduced-motion JS path (CSS already handles via `opacity: 1 !important`)
**Passing checks:** CSS layout/label/blockquote/signature/word/mobile/reduced-motion all correct. GSAP parameters correct. `interlude.css` linked in head. `initInterlude()` imported+called in main.js. `.grain` class applied. Token names correct. Build clean (20 modules, 88ms).
**Full report:** `docs/test-reports/KNOCH-006-test-report.md`
**Completed by:** Tester Agent

**Tickets affected:** KNOCH-022, KNOCH-023, KNOCH-024, KNOCH-025, KNOCH-026  
**Reason:** Adding Sanity CMS so content (testimonials, galleries, hero images) can be managed via Studio UI without code changes  
**Changes:**

### 2026-05-05 — KNOCH-001 QA PASSED on re-test

**Action:** Re-test by Tester Agent. All 8 acceptance criteria now pass.
**Tickets affected:** KNOCH-001
**Reason:** Builder applied the two fixes identified in the initial QA run: `src/js/main.js` and `src/css/global.css` were created as empty stub files. `npm run build` now exits cleanly (`vite v8.0.10`, 5 modules transformed, `dist/` emitted with hashed assets in 33ms).

- Dashboard badge updated: Needs Fixes → QA Passed (green)
- Stat counts updated: In progress 1→0, Done 0→1
**Passing checks:** All 8 ACs — directory tree, vanilla Vite, dev script, npm run build (now PASS), Google Fonts in index.html, .gitignore, package scripts, vite.config base + outDir.

### 2026-05-05 — KNOCH-001 QA FAILED — Needs Fixes

**Action:** QA run by Tester Agent. Build pipeline blocked by missing stub files.
**Tickets affected:** KNOCH-001
**Reason:** `npm run build` exits with a hard error — `src/js/main.js` does not exist (only `.gitkeep` present). `src/index.html` references this file as a `<script type="module">` entry, so Vite cannot resolve it and emits no `dist/` output. `src/css/global.css` is similarly absent but does not block the build on its own.
**Changes:**
- KNOCH-001: Status changed IN REVIEW → NEEDS FIXES
**Failing checks:**
1. **BLOCKER — AC-4 (`npm run build`):** `Error: Failed to resolve /src/js/main.js from src/index.html`. Fix: create `src/js/main.js` as a minimal stub ES module.
2. **LOW — `src/css/global.css` missing:** Browser will 404 on the stylesheet link. Fix: create `src/css/global.css` as an empty stub (content will be added in KNOCH-002).
**Passing checks:** AC-1 (directory tree), AC-2 (vanilla Vite), AC-5 (Google Fonts in index.html), AC-6 (.gitignore), AC-7 (package scripts), AC-8 (vite.config base + outDir), GSAP/Lenis as npm deps.
